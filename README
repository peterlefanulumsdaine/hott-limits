 
To use the files in this directory, you need to have a version of Coq suitable for use with homotopy type theory, as well as the homotopy type theory library. To obtain both of these, follow the directions in the README file here:

  https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT
  
Assuming hoqc is in the system path, typing the command

  make

in the directory with these files will then compile most of the source files, 

  make all
  
will compile all of them, and

  make sequences
  make limits
  
will compile everything except for Pullbacks3.v, which takes a long time.

Assuming hoqtop is in the system path, you can then explore the files using Proof General or the Coq IDE.

These files have been tested under the following version of the HoTT library:

  ccf55c60b90404611f1dd377a4e47a12fae08c05
  
We used the following version of Coq 8.4:

  0e7800c3f9fbb7313c8f1ad194e8163988ec6ecd
  
This library may evolve in the future. For the current version, look here:
