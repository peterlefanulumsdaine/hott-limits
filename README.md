hott-limits
===========

A formalization of (homotopy) limits in Homotopy Type Theory.  This accompanies the paper “Homotopy limits in Coq” (Jeremy Avigad, Krzysztof Kapulkin, Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine), and includes a complete formalization of the results presented there.

Note: this library is still under development, and contains many rough edges.
